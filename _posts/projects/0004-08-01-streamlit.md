<p>The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is revolutionizing the way industries operate by enabling real-time monitoring, data-driven decision-making, and predictive analytics. To harness the potential of IIoT, businesses need intuitive, scalable, and efficient tools to visualize and interact with the data collected from connected devices and systems. This project focuses on developing an Industrial IoT Dashboard using Streamlit, a powerful Python-based web application framework for creating interactive and customizable dashboards. </p><br>

<h1>Why is it so important?</h1><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Business Requirements:</b><br>
-	The accurate analytical reports must be accessible to the senior management and administrative staff at their desk.<br>
-	Development of an employee incentive scheme to promote their growth in resolving unplanned machine downtime quickly.<br>
-	Enhancing the scope of existing maintenance contracts with OEM vendors.<br>
-	Boosting their current OEE of 40% by having an eagle eye vision on all machine performances in depth to take business decisions.<br><br>
<b>Technical Requirements:</b><br>
-	The scalability of the application as it must cater to all the CNC machines irrespective of their make.<br>
-	Cybersecurity angle to secure the data being collected.<br>
-	Hybrid infrastructure of handling the data on both locally and on the cloud.<br>
-	Implementing machine learning algorithms to effectively predict potential downtimes.<br>
