<center><h2>Best Friends with a Robot!</h2></center> -->



<p>This summer I implemented a prototype of cleaning robot with various algorithms to replicate a smaller version of Roomba.</p> 

<!-- <br> 
<p>I was able to showcase three projects at these events: <a href="https://javtges.github.io/pancakerobot/" target="_blank"><u>Robotic Pancake Chef</u></a>, <a href="https://javtges.github.io/textureclassification/" target="_blank"><u>Tactile Texture Classification</u></a>, and <a href="https://javtges.github.io/gesturerecognition/" target="_blank"><u>Deep Learning for Gesture Recognition</u></a>. Check out Northwestern MSR's 'Inside Our Program' <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/inside-our-program/stories/2022/bringing-robotics-to-the-public.html" target="_blank"><u>article</u></a>, written by <a href="https://www.zarefsky.com/" target="_blank"><u>Marc Zarefsky</u></a>.

“It’s always a good learning experience to practice communicating technical details to a wide variety of people,” he said. “It’s good to know what other people know and don’t know, and what perspectives they have. We can often get caught up in our own bubble as students, so it’s good to talk to and hear from people outside of academia.”
