<p>My Master's thesis focuses on the design and control of a <strong>5-DOF bio-inspired worm robot</strong> that mimics inchworm-like locomotion through metachronal gait patterns. Inspired by real-world biological strategies such as those seen in caterpillars and centipedes, the project integrates advanced modeling, control, and simulation techniques to achieve realistic movement across uneven terrains and confined environments.</p>

### üìå Objectives
- Design a modular, scalable worm-inspired robot using LX-16A servos.
- Develop forward and inverse kinematics models using **Geometric Algebra** and **Screw Theory**.
- Implement and compare various controllers: **PD**, **PID**, **Fractional PID**, **Sliding Mode**, and **Koopman-based PID**.
- Validate control strategies via both **simulation (Isaac Sim)** and real hardware.
- Develop a **Digital Twin** that synchronizes physical and simulated models for real-time testing.

<br>

### üîç Technical Highlights

#### ‚úÖ Kinematics & Dynamics
- Forward kinematics via **rotor algebra** and **dual quaternion representations**.
- Inverse kinematics derived for metachronal gaits, validated in Isaac Sim.
- Full **Euler-Lagrange** formulation and dynamic modeling for 5-DOF system.
