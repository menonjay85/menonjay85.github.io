I'm a Roboticist, Maker, and TSMC Research Fellow completing my M.S. in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at Arizona State University. My work focuses on robot learning for autonomous navigation, object manipulation, and control systems, with a particular interest in bio-inspired robotics.

Beyond engineering, I served as a graduate writing tutor at ASU's Graduate Writing Center, where I assisted fellow graduate students in developing their academic writing skills! ðŸŽ“
