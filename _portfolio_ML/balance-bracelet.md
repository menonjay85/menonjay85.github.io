This project introduces a cost-effective, wearable solution for managing physiological stress through coherent breathing‚Äîa technique involving synchronized 6-second inhalation and exhalation cycles. Our device, the Balance Bracelet, guides users to physiological coherence using PPG sensors, haptic feedback, and a real-time breathing assistant. The system not only empowers individual stress management but offers clinical relevance for broader mental health applications. The project encompasses a complete pipeline from hardware prototyping and physiological signal analysis to deep learning‚Äìbased stress classification and web-based biofeedback integration.

## Introduction 
Modern life has escalated chronic stress levels, with adults aged 35‚Äì44 being severely affected. Current solutions‚Äîmedication, therapy, and generic wearables‚Äîare either inaccessible or not personalized for breathing-based interventions.

Coherent breathing has shown potential to:
- Enhance heart rate variability (HRV)
- Improve autonomic nervous balance
- Reduce anxiety, depression, and cardiovascular risks

## Objective
Design and develop a non-invasive, user-friendly wearable that guides users through coherent breathing and quantifies physiological coherence using real-time HRV and respiratory rate monitoring.

## System Design and Architecture
### Hardware Architecture
- **Processor:** Arduino Mega
- **Sensors:** Dual Gravity PPG sensors for HRV and HR
- **Actuators:** Vibration motor for haptic feedback
- **Display:** OLED screen for real-time coherence status
- **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi + BLE for mobile/web integration
